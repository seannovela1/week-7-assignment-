                <p>
                    Over the last eight weeks, I found the structured lessons and the hands-on projects to be very beneficial. The consistent practice of coding and working through real-world problems helped reinforce my understanding of concepts. The weekly assignments and feedback were also very helpful, as they allowed me to identify areas for improvement.
