                <h2>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the last eight weeks, I found the structured lessons and the hands-on projects to be very beneficial. The consistent practice of coding and working through real-world problems helped reinforce my understanding of concepts. The weekly assignments and feedback were also very helpful, as they allowed me to identify areas for improvement.

                <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
                <p>
                    One change I would suggest is incorporating more interactive and collaborative activities. For example, group coding challenges or peer reviews could help reinforce learning and encourage collaboration. More real-world case studies or projects would also help make the course even more practical and engaging.

                <h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, the course met my expectations. I expected to learn more about web development, especially front-end technologies, and the course provided a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I feel more confident in my ability to build simple websites and understand how these technologies work together.

                <h2>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the concepts that were new to me included advanced CSS techniques, such as Flexbox and Grid, as well as JavaScript DOM manipulation. I had already encountered HTML and basic CSS, but the depth of knowledge I gained about layout techniques and responsive design was new and exciting. The introduction to JavaScript programming also gave me a deeper understanding of how web pages become interactive.
